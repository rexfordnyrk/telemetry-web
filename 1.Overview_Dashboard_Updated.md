# 1. Overview Dashboard - Widget Mapping and API Specifications (Updated)

This document maps each data point from the Overview Dashboard section to suitable widgets found in the Maxton template pages, provides suggested modifications, and specifies the required API object structures with integrated chart data.

## Device & Participant Management

- labels: distributions.map(d => d.district)

**Database Query**:

```sql
SELECT
    d.district,
    COUNT(*) as device_count,

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'pending') as syncs_in_progress,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'success') as completed_syncs,
    COUNT(*) as total_syncs,
    ROUND((COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'success') * 100.0 / COUNT(*)), 1) as completion_percentage
FROM sync_logs
WHERE sync_started_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

## Summary: Chart Data Requirements

### Widgets that require separate queries (chart data not derivable):

1. **Total Active Devices** - needs time-series of daily active device counts
2. **Total Beneficiaries** - needs time-series of daily enrollment counts
3. **New Enrollments This Month** - needs weekly enrollment breakdown
4. **Sync Success Rate** - needs daily success rate time-series
5. **Network Activity Live** - needs hourly network usage data

### Widgets where chart data can be derived from main API response:

1. **Device Assignment Rate** - progress bar only, no chart
2. **Geographic Distribution** - pie chart derived from distributions array
3. **Data Collection Coverage** - progress bars only, no chart
4. **Last Sync Status** - list widget only, no chart
5. **Currently Active Devices** - progress bar only, no chart
6. **Live Sync Status** - radial chart derived from completionPercentage

## API Endpoint Strategy

For widgets requiring separate chart data, the API should return both main metrics and chart data in a single response to minimize database queries and improve performance.

### Suggested API Endpoints

1. **GET /api/dashboard/overview/devices** - Returns: totalActiveDevices, totalBeneficiaries, deviceAssignmentRate
2. **GET /api/dashboard/overview/enrollment** - Returns: newEnrollmentsThisMonth with chart data
3. **GET /api/dashboard/overview/geographic** - Returns: geographicDistribution (chart derived from data)
4. **GET /api/dashboard/overview/sync-health** - Returns: syncSuccessRate, dataCollectionCoverage, syncStatus
5. **GET /api/dashboard/overview/realtime** - Returns: currentlyActiveDevices, networkActivityLive, liveSyncStatus
