# 16. Usage Events Analytics

## Event Analysis

### 1. Event Type Distribution (Breakdown of usage event types)

**Widget Mapping**: Device Type Pie Chart Widget (maxton/index.html - Line 1131-1183)
**Original Title**: "Device Type" with pie chart and device breakdown
**Suggested Title**: "Event Type Distribution"
**Page Reference**: index.html

**Required Changes**:
- Change title from "Device Type" to "Event Type Distribution"
- Replace device icons (desktop, tablet, mobile) with event type icons
- Change center metric from "68% Total Views" to "Total Events Today"
- Replace device percentages with event type percentages
- Update legend to show event types instead of device types

FROM usage_events ue
WHERE DATE(ue.created_at) = CURDATE()
GROUP BY ue.event_type
ORDER BY event_count DESC;
```

### 5. Usage Events (Granular event logs for comprehensive activity analysis)

**Widget Mapping**: Recent Orders Table Widget (maxton/index.html - Line 1658-1795)
**Original Title**: "Recent Orders" with searchable data table
**Suggested Title**: "Usage Event Logs"
**Page Reference**: index.html

**Required Changes**:
- Change title from "Recent Orders" to "Usage Event Logs"
- Replace order columns with event columns (Timestamp, Device, Event Type, Package, Activity, Duration)
- Add event filtering by type, device, and time range
- Replace order status with event status indicators
- Add real-time updates for new events
