### 5.2.3 Network Infrastructure Impact

**Widget Reference:** Small metric cards (from widgets-data.html, lines 1154-1329)  
**Page:** widgets-data.html  
**Original Title:** Active Users / Total Users  
**Suggested Title:** Network Quality by Region

**Required Wording Changes:**

- Change "Active Users" to "Network Quality Score"
- Change "Total Users" to "Connectivity Rating"
- Replace user counts with network performance metrics
- Add network quality indicators and scores
