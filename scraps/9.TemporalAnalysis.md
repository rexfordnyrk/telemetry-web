### Database Queries

#### Main Datapoint Query
```sql
-- Historical data for prediction model
WITH daily_usage AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE(created_at) as usage_date,
        COUNT(*) as daily_sessions,
        COUNT(DISTINCT device_id) as active_devices
    FROM app_sessions 
    WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
    GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
    ORDER BY usage_date
),
trend_calculation AS (
    SELECT 
        usage_date,
        daily_sessions,
        AVG(daily_sessions) OVER (ORDER BY usage_date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as moving_avg_7day,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY usage_date) as day_number
    FROM daily_usage
)
SELECT 
    usage_date,
    daily_sessions,

    -- Simple linear regression for trend
    ROUND(
        (SELECT AVG(daily_sessions) FROM daily_usage) +

            NULLIF((SELECT SUM(POWER(day_number - avg_day, 2)) FROM 
                (SELECT day_number, AVG(day_number) OVER () as avg_day FROM trend_calculation) t2
            ), 0)
        )
    ) as predicted_sessions

```

#### Chart Data Query (Future Prediction)
```sql
-- Generate future predictions based on trend
WITH historical_trend AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE(created_at) as usage_date,
        COUNT(*) as daily_sessions,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY DATE(created_at)) as day_number
    FROM app_sessions 
    WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
    GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
),
trend_coefficients AS (
    SELECT 
        AVG(daily_sessions) as avg_sessions,
        AVG(day_number) as avg_day,
        SUM((day_number - AVG(day_number) OVER ()) * (daily_sessions - AVG(daily_sessions) OVER ())) / 
        NULLIF(SUM(POWER(day_number - AVG(day_number) OVER (), 2)), 0) as slope
    FROM historical_trend
)
SELECT 
    CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '1 day' * s.day_offset as predicted_date,
    ROUND(tc.avg_sessions + (30 + s.day_offset - tc.avg_day) * tc.slope) as predicted_sessions,
    ROUND((tc.avg_sessions + (30 + s.day_offset - tc.avg_day) * tc.slope) * 0.85) as confidence_lower,
    ROUND((tc.avg_sessions + (30 + s.day_offset - tc.avg_day) * tc.slope) * 1.15) as confidence_upper
FROM generate_series(1, 30) s(day_offset)
CROSS JOIN trend_coefficients tc
ORDER BY predicted_date;
