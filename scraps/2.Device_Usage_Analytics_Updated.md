# 2. Device Usage Analytics - Widget Mapping and API Specifications (Updated)

This document maps each data point from the Device Usage Analytics section to suitable widgets found in the Maxton template pages, provides suggested modifications, and specifies the required API object structures with integrated chart data.

## Device-Level Metrics

### 1. Active vs Inactive Devices

**Widget Source**: Pie chart widget (index2.html - lines 1124-1177)
**Original Widget Title**: "Order Status"
**Page Reference**: index2.html

**Suggested Changes**:

- Change title from "Order Status" to "Device Activity Status"
- Update center text from "68% Total Sales" to "X% Active Devices"
- Change legend items from "Sales/Product/Income" to "Active/Inactive/Maintenance"
- Update percentages to reflect actual device activity distribution

**Chart Data Derivable**: Yes - can be derived from categories array

**API Data Structure**:

```json
{
  "deviceActivityStatus": {
    "totalDevices": 247,
    "activePercentage": 78.5,
    "categories": [
      {
        "status": "Active",
        "count": 194,
        "percentage": 78.5,
        "color": "#198754"
      },
      {
        "status": "Inactive",
        "count": 38,
        "percentage": 15.4,
        "color": "#dc3545"
      },
      {
        "status": "Maintenance",
        "count": 15,
        "percentage": 6.1,
        "color": "#ffc107"
      }
    ],
    "chartData": {
      "type": "pie",
      "series": [78.5, 15.4, 6.1],
      "labels": ["Active", "Inactive", "Maintenance"],
      "colors": ["#198754", "#dc3545", "#ffc107"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: Chart data can be automatically generated from the categories array using:

- series: categories.map(c => c.percentage)
- labels: categories.map(c => c.status)
- colors: categories.map(c => c.color)

**Database Query**:

```sql
WITH device_activity AS (
  SELECT
    d.id,
    d.device_name,
    MAX(sl.sync_completed_at) as last_sync,
    CASE
      WHEN MAX(sl.sync_completed_at) >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours' THEN 'Active'
      WHEN MAX(sl.sync_completed_at) >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days' THEN 'Inactive'
      ELSE 'Maintenance'
    END as status
  FROM devices d
  LEFT JOIN sync_logs sl ON d.id = sl.device_id AND sl.status = 'success'
  WHERE d.is_active = true
  GROUP BY d.id, d.device_name
)
SELECT
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  ROUND((COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER()), 1) as percentage
FROM device_activity
GROUP BY status;
```

### 2. Device Health Status

**Widget Source**: Campaign Stats list widget (index.html - lines 1263-1385)
**Original Widget Title**: "Campaign Stats"
**Page Reference**: index.html

**Suggested Changes**:

- Replace campaign items with health status categories:
  - "Online" with device count and percentage (green icon)
  - "Offline" with device count and percentage (red icon)
  - "Syncing" with device count and percentage (blue icon)
  - "Warning" with device count and percentage (orange icon)
- Update icons to be device/health related

**Chart Data Derivable**: Yes - no chart required for this widget (list with progress indicators only)

**API Data Structure**:

    CASE
      WHEN COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE sl.status = 'pending' AND sl.sync_started_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour') > 0 THEN 'Syncing'
      WHEN COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE sl.status = 'failed' AND sl.sync_started_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours') > 2 THEN 'Warning'
      WHEN MAX(sl.sync_completed_at) >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour' THEN 'Online'
      ELSE 'Offline'
    END as health_status
  FROM devices d
  LEFT JOIN sync_logs sl ON d.id = sl.device_id
  WHERE d.is_active = true
  GROUP BY d.id, d.device_name
)
SELECT
  health_status,
  COUNT(*) as count,

```

**Note**: Chart data can be automatically generated using:

- series: [performanceScore] for each device

**Database Query**:

```sql

    d.id,
    d.device_name,
    d.district,
    COUNT(sl.id) as total_syncs,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE sl.status = 'success') as successful_syncs,
    ROUND((COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE sl.status = 'success') * 100.0 / NULLIF(COUNT(sl.id), 0)), 1) as sync_success_rate,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (sl.sync_completed_at - sl.sync_started_at))/60) as avg_sync_duration
  FROM devices d
  LEFT JOIN sync_logs sl ON d.id = sl.device_id
    AND sl.sync_started_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'

**Suggested Changes**:

- Change title from "Monthly Revenue" to "Device Reliability Score"
- Update main percentage from "68.9%" to overall reliability percentage
- Change description to reflect device reliability metrics
- Update trend indicator to show reliability improvement

**Chart Data Derivable**: Yes - can be derived from overallScore

## Usage Patterns

### 6. Daily Usage Patterns

**Widget Source**: Sales & Views line chart (widgets-data.html - lines 1387-1439)
**Original Widget Title**: "Sales & Views"
**Page Reference**: widgets-data.html

**Suggested Changes**:

- Change title from "Sales & Views" to "Daily Usage Patterns"
- Update chart to show hourly usage across devices
- Change bottom metrics from "Monthly/Yearly" to "Peak Hour/Average Usage"
- Update time series to show 24-hour activity patterns

**Chart Data Derivable**: No - requires separate hourly usage time-series data

**API Data Structure with Chart Data**:

## Device Health Monitoring

### 9. Device Reliability Score

**Widget Source**: Trending Products gauge chart (widgets-data.html - lines 1463-1484)
**Original Widget Title**: "Trending Products"
**Page Reference**: widgets-data.html

**Suggested Changes**:

- Change title from "Trending Products" to "System Health Score"
- Update main percentage from "48.2%" to overall system health score
- Change description to reflect overall system health
- Update background gradient to reflect health status

**Chart Data Derivable**: Yes - can be derived from overallScore

**API Data Structure**:

```json

### 11. Battery Usage Patterns

**Widget Source**: Total Profit gauge with progress (index2.html - lines 1765-1792)
**Original Widget Title**: "Total Profit"
**Page Reference**: index2.html

**Suggested Changes**:

- Change title from "Total Profit" to "Battery Usage Patterns"
- Update main value from "$15.7K" to average screen time
- Change description to battery/screen usage context
- Update trend indicator for battery usage changes

**Chart Data Derivable**: Yes - can be derived from batteryHealthScore

**API Data Structure**:

## Summary: Chart Data Requirements

### Widgets that require separate queries (chart data not derivable):

1. **Daily Usage Patterns** - needs hourly session count time-series data
2. **Weekly Usage Patterns** - needs weekly breakdown data with trend data per day
3. **Session Duration Analysis** - needs weekly average duration time-series data

### Widgets where chart data can be derived from main API response:

1. **Device Activity Status** - pie chart derived from categories array
2. **Device Health Status** - list widget only, no chart
3. **Device Assignment History** - table only, no chart
4. **Device Performance** - radial charts derived from performance scores
5. **Device Reliability** - radial chart derived from overallScore
6. **System Health Score** - radial chart derived from overallScore
7. **Usage Anomaly Detection** - list widget only, no chart
8. **Battery Usage Patterns** - radial chart derived from batteryHealthScore

## API Endpoint Strategy

For widgets requiring separate chart data, the API should return both main metrics and chart data in a single response to minimize database queries and improve performance.

### Suggested API Endpoints

1. **GET /api/dashboard/device-usage/metrics** - Returns: deviceActivityStatus, deviceHealthStatus, deviceReliability
2. **GET /api/dashboard/device-usage/performance** - Returns: devicePerformance, deviceAssignmentHistory
3. **GET /api/dashboard/device-usage/patterns** - Returns: dailyUsagePatterns, weeklyUsagePatterns, sessionDurationAnalysis
4. **GET /api/dashboard/device-usage/health** - Returns: systemHealthScore, usageAnomalies, batteryUsagePatterns

### Real-time Update Strategy

- **Real-time (5-10 seconds)**: deviceHealthStatus, usageAnomalies
- **Frequent (30 seconds)**: systemHealthScore, deviceReliability
- **Regular (2 minutes)**: deviceActivityStatus, devicePerformance
- **Periodic (5 minutes)**: dailyUsagePatterns, batteryUsagePatterns
- **Scheduled (15 minutes)**: weeklyUsagePatterns, sessionDurationAnalysis, deviceAssignmentHistory
