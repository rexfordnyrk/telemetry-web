## 8. Benchmark Analysis

### Widget Mapping
**Suggested Widget**: Total Sales Card with Chart (maxton/widgets-data.html, lines 1015-1032)  
**Page Reference**: widgets-data.html  
**Widget Title**: "Total Sales"

### Wording Changes
- Change "Total Sales" to "Benchmark Performance"
- Change "$9,568" to benchmark score
- Change "8.6%" to variance from benchmark
- Update icon from "arrow_downward" to performance indicator

### API Object Structure
```json
{
  "benchmark_analysis": {
    "benchmark_score": 87.3,
    "variance_percentage": -8.6,
    "trend_direction": "down",
    "title": "Benchmark Performance",
    "description": "Performance vs Industry Standard",
    "chart_data": [45, 52, 48, 61, 55, 67, 58, 64, 59, 70],
    "performance_level": "good"
  }
}
```

### Chart Data Structure
```javascript
// Sparkline chart for benchmark tracking
{
  chart: {
    type: 'line',
    height: 80,
    sparkline: {
      enabled: true
    }
  },
  series: [{
    data: [45, 52, 48, 61, 55, 67, 58, 64, 59, 70]
  }],
  colors: ['#dc3545']
}
```

### Database Query
```sql

## Summary

This document provides comprehensive mappings for all 8 Combined Entity Analysis datapoints to appropriate Maxton dashboard widgets. Each mapping includes:

1. **Widget Selection**: Carefully chosen widgets that best represent the data type and visualization needs
2. **Wording Adaptations**: Specific text changes to make widgets contextually appropriate for telemetry data
3. **API Structure**: Complete JSON object structures that match the widget data requirements
4. **Chart Configurations**: ApexCharts and other chart configurations that align with existing widget patterns
5. **Database Queries**: Complex SQL queries that generate the required analytics data
6. **Chart Data Queries**: Specific queries for populating chart visualizations

The mappings leverage the full range of Maxton's widget types - from simple metric cards to complex correlation charts - ensuring comprehensive coverage of combined entity analytics requirements for the telemetry dashboard system.
