    "unit": "bytes",
    "displayValue": "47.35 GB",
    "percentageChange": 12.4,
    "trend": "up",
    "period": "last_30_days"
  }
}
```

**Chart Data Structure:**

**Suggested Title:** Network Efficiency Score

**Required Wording Changes:**

- Change "Monthly Revenue" to "Network Efficiency Score"
- Change "68.9%" to efficiency score
- Change "34.5%" to efficiency improvement
- Change description to efficiency metrics

**API Object Structure:**

```json
{
  "networkEfficiencyScore": {
    "efficiencyScore": 78.4,
    "maxScore": 100,
    "improvementRate": 6.2,
    "trend": "up",
    "factors": {
      "dataOptimization": 82.1,
      "syncReliability": 94.2,
      "bandwidthUtilization": 68.7
    },
    "period": "last_30_days"
  }
}
```

**Chart Data Structure:**

```json
{
  "chartData": {
    "type": "radialBar",
    "series": [78.4],
    "labels": ["Efficiency Score"],
    "plotOptions": {
      "radialBar": {
        "hollow": {
          "size": "70%"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**SQL Query for Datapoint:**

```sql
WITH efficiency_metrics AS (
  SELECT
    -- Data optimization: successful data transfer rate
    ROUND((COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE total_bytes > 0) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)), 2) as data_optimization,

    -- Sync reliability from sync_logs
    (SELECT ROUND((COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'success') * 100.0 / COUNT(*)), 2)
     FROM sync_logs
     WHERE sync_started_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
       AND sync_type = 'network_usage') as sync_reliability,

    -- Bandwidth utilization: ratio of actual vs potential usage
    ROUND((AVG(total_bytes) / 50000000 * 100), 2) as bandwidth_utilization
  FROM network_usages
  WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
    AND deleted_at IS NULL
)
SELECT
  data_optimization,
  sync_reliability,
  bandwidth_utilization,
  ROUND((data_optimization + sync_reliability + bandwidth_utilization) / 3, 2) as overall_efficiency_score
FROM efficiency_metrics;
```
