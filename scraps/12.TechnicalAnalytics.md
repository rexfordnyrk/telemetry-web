## 8. Missing Data Analysis

### Widget Mapping
**Suggested Widget**: Recent Orders Table Widget (maxton/index.html, lines 1658-1794)  
**Page Reference**: index.html  
**Widget Title**: "Recent Orders"

### Wording Changes
- Change "Recent Orders" to "Missing Data Analysis"
- Change table headers from "Item Name/Amount/Vendor/Status/Rating" to "Data Field/Missing Count/Affected Tables/Severity/Impact Score"
- Replace product data with missing data patterns
- Update status indicators to show data quality levels

## Summary

This document provides comprehensive mappings for all 9 Technical Analytics datapoints to appropriate Maxton dashboard widgets. Each mapping includes:

1. **Strategic Widget Selection**: Widgets chosen based on data visualization requirements and user interface patterns
2. **Contextual Wording**: Specific text adaptations to make widgets appropriate for technical telemetry metrics
3. **Complete API Structures**: Detailed JSON objects that match widget data consumption patterns
4. **Chart Configurations**: Proper chart data structures using ApexCharts and other visualization libraries
5. **Complex Database Queries**: SQL queries that generate comprehensive technical analytics
6. **Trend Analysis Queries**: Specialized queries for tracking technical metrics over time

The mappings cover all aspects of technical analytics:
- **System Performance**: Data collection efficiency, sync performance, storage metrics, API performance
- **Data Quality**: Collection health, completeness, accuracy, missing data analysis, integrity checks

These widgets provide essential monitoring capabilities for the telemetry system, enabling administrators to maintain optimal system performance and ensure high-quality data collection across all deployed devices.
