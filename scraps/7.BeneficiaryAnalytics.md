# 7. Beneficiary Analytics - Widget Mapping

This document maps Beneficiary Analytics datapoints to suitable widgets from the Maxton template pages (index.html, index2.html, widgets-data.html).

## 7.1 Individual Performance

### 7.1.1 Beneficiary Activity Score

**Widget Reference:** Card with progress and stats (from widgets-data.html, lines 1073-1098)  
**Page:** widgets-data.html  
**Original Title:** Sale This Year  
**Suggested Title:** Beneficiary Activity Score

**Required Wording Changes:**

- Change "Sale This Year" to "Overall Activity Score"
- Change "$65,129" to activity score (e.g., "87.4")
- Change "24.7%" to score improvement percentage
- Change "285 left to Goal" to "Target: 90.0"
- Change progress bar to show activity score percentage

**API Object Structure:**
